# MrBuggy7-manual-testing

This repo contains artifacts from the manual testing process of the **MrBuggy7** desktop application. <br> 
In the files, you will find written test cases, and I also plan to upload reports from conducted tests. I tested the application on a 64-bit Windows 10 environment. <br>

**Testing tools:** <br>
TestRail <br>
Jira <br>
PicPick <br>
ShareX <br>

**Environment:** <br>
Windows 10 (64-bit)
